#Dennis Nedry Alert

This is a little Jquery plug in I just started working on. Inspired by Jurassic, this will make an alert sound play when a user tries to submit a form and has not filled in a required text area.

Dennis Nedry will appear on the bottom of your screen and say "ah ah ah, you didn't say the magic word."
